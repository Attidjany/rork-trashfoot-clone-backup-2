  p.name,
  p.gamer_handle,
  p.role,
  p.status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN players p ON p.auth_user_id = u.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC;

-- Check player stats
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.gamer_handle,
  ps.played,
  ps.wins,
  ps.draws,
  ps.losses,
  ps.points
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN player_stats ps ON ps.player_id = p.id AND ps.group_id IS NULL
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT 
  'Auth users without player profile' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN players p ON p.auth_user_id = u.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Players without stats' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM players p
