# Knockout Tournament Fix Instructions

## Issues Fixed

1. **Knockout bracket display showing empty** - Fixed by adding `stage` and `match_order` properties to the Match type
2. **Next stage matches not being created automatically** - Fixed by creating a proper database trigger
3. **Matches not being randomized at creation** - Fixed by shuffling participants in the backend

## What Was Done

### 1. Type System Updates
- Added `stage?: string` and `match_order?: number` to the `Match` interface in `types/game.ts`
- Removed type assertions (`as any`) from `app/tournament-bracket.tsx` since the types are now properly defined

### 2. Database Schema
- Created `backend/FIX_KNOCKOUT_COMPLETE.sql` which:
  - Ensures `stage` and `match_order` columns exist on the `matches` table
  - Enables realtime for the matches table
  - Creates a trigger `trigger_progress_tournament_stage` that automatically creates next stage matches when all matches in the current stage are completed
  - Includes verification checks

### 3. Backend Logic
- The `generateMatches` function in `backend/trpc/routes/competitions/management/route.ts` already includes:
  - `shuffleArray` function to randomize participants
  - Proper stage assignment based on participant count
  - Match order assignment

## Steps to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script
Execute the SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```bash
backend/FIX_KNOCKOUT_COMPLETE.sql
```

This will:
- Add required columns if missing
- Enable realtime for matches
- Create the tournament progression trigger
- Run verification checks

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After running the SQL script, check the output for:
- âœ“ Stage column exists
- âœ“ Match_order column exists  
- âœ“ Realtime enabled for matches
- âœ“ Tournament progression trigger exists
- âœ“ Tournament progression function exists

### Step 3: Test the Functionality

#### Test 1: Create a New Knockout Tournament
1. Create a knockout tournament with 4 players
2. Verify that:
   - Initial matches are created with different pairings each time (randomization)
   - Matches appear in the tournament bracket page
   - Each match has a stage (e.g., "semi_final")
   - Each match has a match_order (1, 2, etc.)

#### Test 2: Complete Matches and Verify Progression
1. Complete all matches in the first stage (e.g., both semi-final matches)
2. Verify that:
   - The final match is automatically created
   - The final match appears in the bracket
   - Winners from the semi-finals are correctly paired in the final
   - A third-place match is created (for semi-finals only)

#### Test 3: Check Chat Messages
1. Create a new knockout tournament
2. Verify the chat message shows:
   - Correct number of participants
   - Correct number of matches
   - Participant names

## How the Tournament Progression Works

### Stage Flow
```
4 players:  semi_final â†’ final + third_place
8 players:  quarter_final â†’ semi_final â†’ final + third_place
16 players: round_of_16 â†’ quarter_final â†’ semi_final â†’ final + third_place
```

### Trigger Logic
When a match is completed:
1. Check if all matches in the current stage are completed
2. If yes, determine the next stage
3. Get winners from current stage (ordered by match_order)
4. Create matches for next stage by pairing winners sequentially
5. If completing semi-finals, also create a third-place match with the losers

### Randomization
- Participants are shuffled using Fisher-Yates algorithm before creating initial matches
- This ensures different pairings each time a tournament is created
- The shuffle happens in `generateMatches()` function in the backend

## Troubleshooting

### Bracket Still Shows Empty
1. Check if matches have `stage` and `match_order` values:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, stage, match_order FROM matches WHERE competition_id = 'YOUR_COMPETITION_ID';
   ```
2. If null, the matches were created before the fix. Delete and recreate the tournament.

### Next Stage Not Creating
1. Check if the trigger exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_progress_tournament_stage';
   ```
2. Check trigger logs in Supabase Dashboard â†’ Database â†’ Logs
3. Look for RAISE NOTICE messages that show trigger execution

### Matches Not Random
1. Verify the `shuffleArray` function is being called in `generateMatches()`
2. Check console logs for "ðŸŽ² Shuffled participants for knockout:"
3. Create multiple tournaments and verify different pairings

## Files Modified

1. `types/game.ts` - Added stage and match_order to Match interface
2. `app/tournament-bracket.tsx` - Removed type assertions
3. `backend/FIX_KNOCKOUT_COMPLETE.sql` - New SQL script with complete fix

## Files Already Correct

1. `backend/trpc/routes/competitions/management/route.ts` - Already has randomization logic
2. `hooks/use-realtime-groups.tsx` - Already fetches stage and match_order
3. `app/(tabs)/matches.tsx` - Already displays tournaments correctly

## Next Steps

After applying this fix:
1. Test with different player counts (4, 8, 16)
2. Verify progression through all stages
3. Check that old tournaments (created before fix) may need to be recreated
4. Monitor Supabase logs for any trigger errors
