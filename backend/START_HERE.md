# üö® RLS Policy Rebuild - START HERE

## Current Status
Your app is live but broken due to RLS policy issues. We need to fix this carefully.

## What You Need To Do RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Export Current State (5 minutes)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Open the file: `backend/STEP1_EXPORT_CURRENT_STATE.sql`
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. **SAVE THE ENTIRE OUTPUT** to a text file on your computer
7. Share the output here

### Step 2: Diagnose Schema (5 minutes)

1. Still in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Open the file: `backend/STEP2_DIAGNOSE_SCHEMA.sql`
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. **SAVE THE ENTIRE OUTPUT** to a text file
7. Share the output here

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - DO NOT SKIP

**DO NOT run any other SQL files yet!**

The other SQL files have errors because they were created without knowing:
- Your exact table structure
- Your exact column names
- Your current policies

Once you share the output from Steps 1 and 2, I will:
1. Review your actual database structure
2. Create a correct rebuild script
3. Test it for errors before you run it
4. Guide you through the fix step-by-step

## Why This Matters

Previous attempts failed because:
- ‚ùå Scripts referenced wrong column names (`handle` vs `gamer_handle`)
- ‚ùå Scripts had type mismatches (boolean vs text)
- ‚ùå We didn't know the actual current state

This time:
- ‚úÖ We'll see your actual schema first
- ‚úÖ We'll use correct column names
- ‚úÖ We'll create policies that match your data
- ‚úÖ We'll test before running

## Time Estimate
- Running these 2 scripts: 10 minutes
- Reviewing and creating fix: 15 minutes
- Applying the fix: 5 minutes
- Testing: 10 minutes
- **Total: ~40 minutes to completely fix**

## Ready?

Run those 2 SQL scripts and share the output. Let's fix this properly! üöÄ
