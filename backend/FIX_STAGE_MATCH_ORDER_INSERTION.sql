-- FIX STAGE AND MATCH_ORDER NOT BEING POPULATED
-- ============================================

-- Step 1: Verify columns exist
SELECT

  is_nullable

WHERE table_schema = 'public'

-- Step 2: Check recent knockout competitions and their matches

-- Step 4: Check if there are any RLS policies blocking inserts
SELECT

-- Step 6: Show the structure of matches table
