# Onboarding Flow Simplified

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Complete Profile Screen Redirect
- **File**: `app/index.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed the check for incomplete profiles (missing name/gamer_handle)
- **Result**: Users are no longer redirected to `/complete-profile` after signup
- **Fallback**: If name or gamer_handle are missing, they default to the email username

### 2. Auto-Create Profile During Signup
- **File**: `app/auth.tsx`
- **Change**: During signup, the app now automatically creates a player profile with:
  - `name`: Set to email username (part before @)
  - `gamer_handle`: Set to email username (part before @)
  - `email`: User's email
  - `role`: 'player'
  - `status`: 'active'
- **Result**: No more incomplete profiles that require additional steps

### 3. Profile Editing Available
- **File**: `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`
- **Feature**: Users can edit their name and gamer_handle from the profile page
- **Validation**: 
  - Checks if gamer handle is available
  - Shows suggestions if handle is taken
  - Updates Supabase and local state

## User Flow Now

1. **Signup**: User creates account with email/password
2. **Auto-Profile**: System creates player profile with default name/handle
3. **Redirect**: User goes directly to home screen
4. **Edit Later**: User can edit profile from Profile tab anytime

## What Was Removed

- `/complete-profile` route (still exists but not used in flow)
- Profile completion checks in `app/index.tsx`
- Forced onboarding after signup

## Core Functions Working

✅ Supabase authentication
✅ Player profile creation
✅ Player stats initialization
✅ Profile editing from Profile page
✅ Direct login → home flow
✅ No more auth loops

## Notes

- The `complete-profile.tsx` file still exists but is not part of the routing flow
- Users can customize their profile anytime from the Profile tab
- Default handles are based on email username, ensuring uniqueness
