# Tournament System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Tournament Bracket Empty**
**Problem:** The tournament bracket page was showing empty because the `stage` and `match_order` columns were not being fetched from the database.

**Solution:** Updated `hooks/use-realtime-groups.tsx` to include `stage` and `match_order` fields when mapping matches from the database.

### 2. **Automatic Stage Progression Not Working**
**Problem:** When all matches in a tournament stage were completed, the next stage matches were not being automatically created.

**Solution:** Created a database trigger `trigger_progress_tournament_stage` that:
- Monitors when matches are completed
- Checks if all matches in the current stage are done
- Automatically creates matches for the next stage with the winners
- Creates the 3rd place match when semi-finals are completed

### 3. **Chat Message Showing 0 Participants and 0 Matches**
**Problem:** The competition creation message in chat was showing 0 participants and 0 matches because the trigger was firing before participants and matches were inserted.

**Solution:** Changed the trigger to fire on `UPDATE OF status` when competition status changes from 'upcoming' to 'active', ensuring all data is inserted first.

## Files Modified

1. **backend/FIX_TOURNAMENT_COMPLETE_V2.sql** (NEW)
   - Complete SQL script to fix all tournament issues
   - Adds missing columns if needed
   - Creates proper triggers for chat messages and stage progression
   - Includes verification checks

2. **hooks/use-realtime-groups.tsx**
   - Added `stage` and `match_order` fields to match mapping
   - Now properly fetches tournament bracket data

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   backend/FIX_TOURNAMENT_COMPLETE_V2.sql
   ```

2. The script will:
   - ✓ Ensure `stage` and `match_order` columns exist on matches table
   - ✓ Create/update the competition notification trigger
   - ✓ Create/update the tournament stage progression trigger
   - ✓ Run verification checks

3. The frontend changes are already applied (hooks/use-realtime-groups.tsx)

## How It Works Now

### Tournament Creation
1. User creates a knockout tournament with N players
2. System creates first stage matches (e.g., quarter-finals for 8 players)
3. Competition status changes to 'active'
4. Chat message is posted with correct participant and match counts

### Stage Progression
1. Players complete matches in current stage
2. When ALL matches in a stage are completed:
   - System identifies winners (higher score wins, or home player in case of draw)
   - Creates matches for next stage pairing winners
   - If semi-finals just completed, also creates 3rd place match
3. New matches appear in tournament bracket automatically via realtime updates

### Tournament Bracket Display
1. Fetches all matches with `stage` and `match_order` data
2. Groups matches by stage (round_of_16, quarter_final, semi_final, final, third_place)
3. Displays in horizontal scrollable bracket view
4. Shows TBD for future matches, player names for scheduled/live/completed matches
5. Allows score entry for scheduled matches

## Stage Flow

For a tournament with N players:
- **8 players:** quarter_final → semi_final → final + third_place
- **4 players:** semi_final → final + third_place  
- **2 players:** final only

The system automatically determines the starting stage based on participant count.

## Verification

After running the SQL script, you should see:
- ✓ Competition notification trigger exists
- ✓ Tournament progression trigger exists
- ✓ Competition notification function exists
- ✓ Tournament progression function exists
- ✓ matches.stage column exists
- ✓ matches.match_order column exists
- ✓ competitions.created_by column exists

## Testing

1. Create a new knockout tournament with 4 players
2. Check chat message shows correct participant count (4) and match count (2)
3. Open tournament bracket - should show 2 semi-final matches
4. Complete both semi-final matches by entering scores
5. Verify that final and 3rd place matches are automatically created
6. Tournament bracket should update in real-time to show new matches
